            <h3>My name is Romeno. I was born in Sri Lanka, did my high school in Oman, my bachelors in the UAE and U.S and am currently doing a post graduate course in Canada. Living in many places has given me an appreciation of different cultures, which is why I love technology as it brings people together. I have been interested in Computer Science since I was very young.</h3>
